User Stories:

New Gathering Page: As a user I want to be able to create a new gathering with specific information (title, description, date, time, latitude and longitude)

See All Page: As a user I want to be able to see all gatherings I posted

Edit Page: As a user I want to be able to update a information (title, description, date, time, latitude and longitude) to reflect my current needs

Delete Functionality: As a user I want to be able to delete a gathering plan if I no longer need it/if it is no longer available


I feel this project would be especially useful to people who want to save their gatherings/plans with specific location information showing on the google map.

But there are few more features I want to add. I want to add more features such as add an function that leads postings posts into calender component to see better and easy view of when the gatherings are on. For authentication functionality, I was trying to use the auth0 library but still working on it.
